## Topic - [Sampling & Aliasing](https://dspfirst.gatech.edu/chapters/04samplin/overview.html)
_The conversion of signals between the analog and digital domains is studied. The basic ideas underlying sampling (A/D conversion) and signal reconstruction (D/A conversion) and the important features of A/D and D/A converters are reviewed._

## [Lab P-8 - Digital Images: A/D and D/A](https://dspfirst.gatech.edu/chapters/04samplin/labs/DigitalImageLab/DigitalImageLab.pdf)
3 Lab Exercises: Sampling, Aliasing and Reconstruction

3.1 Down-Sampling

3.2 Reconstruction of Images

## Lab S-8 - [Spectrograms: Harmonic Lines & Chirp Aliasing](https://dspfirst.gatech.edu/chapters/04samplin/labs/SpecgramHarmonicLinesChirpAliasing/SpecgramHarmonicLinesChirpAliasing.pdf)
2 Lab Exercise

2.1 Spectrogram for a Chirp that Aliases

2.2 Spectrogram of Periodic Signal    

A detailed explanation of each lab section can be seen in the s8.md file.

### Instructions for running
Add the "s8customfunction" folder to you Matlab path in order to be able to use the custom functions in your scripts.  

Navigate to the LabS-8_Exercise2/ folder and run the main.m script.    

An additional way to view are results is in the s8.md file.
