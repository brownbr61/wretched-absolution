## Topic - [Sampling & Aliasing](https://dspfirst.gatech.edu/chapters/04samplin/overview.html)
_The conversion of signals between the analog and digital domains is studied. The basic ideas underlying sampling (A/D conversion) and signal reconstruction (D/A conversion) and the important features of A/D and D/A converters are reviewed._

## [Lab P-8 - Digital Images: A/D and D/A](https://dspfirst.gatech.edu/chapters/04samplin/labs/DigitalImageLab/DigitalImageLab.pdf)
3 Lab Exercises: Sampling, Aliasing and Reconstruction

3.1 Down-Sampling

3.2 Reconstruction of Images

## Lab S-8 - [Spectrograms: Harmonic Lines & Chirp Aliasing](https://dspfirst.gatech.edu/chapters/04samplin/labs/SpecgramHarmonicLinesChirpAliasing/SpecgramHarmonicLinesChirpAliasing.pdf)
2 Lab Exercise

2.1 Spectrogram for a Chirp that Aliases

2.2 Spectrogram of Periodic Signal    

A detailed explanation of each lab section can be seen in the s8.md file.

### Instructions for running
Add the "s8customfunction" folder to you Matlab path in order to be able to use the custom functions in your scripts.  

To generate plots associated with lab section 2.2.1 run the "p2_2_1.m" script.  

To generate plots associated with lab section 2.2.3 run the "p2_2_3.m" script.  

A spectrogram of a chirp signal can be generated by running the "chirpSpectrogram.m" script.
