## Topic - [Sampling & Aliasing](https://dspfirst.gatech.edu/chapters/04samplin/overview.html)
_The conversion of signals between the analog and digital domains is studied. The basic ideas underlying sampling (A/D conversion) and signal reconstruction (D/A conversion) and the important features of A/D and D/A converters are reviewed._
