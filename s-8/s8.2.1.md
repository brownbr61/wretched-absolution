# 2.1 Spectrogram for a Chirp that Aliases

_Use the code provided in the pre-Lab section as a starting point in order to write a MATLAB script or function that will synthesize a “chirp” signal. Then use that M-file in this section._

## (a) Chirp Beyond the Nyquist Rate

_What happens when we make a signal that “chirps” up to a very high frequency, and the instantaneous frequency goes past half the sampling rate? Generate a chirp signal that starts at $1000 Hz$ when $t=0s$, and chirps up to $11,000 Hz$, at $t=4 s$. Use $f_s = 4000 Hz$._

### The needed parameters are

* `f = [1000 11000];`
* `t = [0 4];`
* `fs = [4000];`

The above parameters result in the following function call:

```matlab
%% Chirp Beyond Nyquist Rate
f = [1000 11000];
t = [0 4];
fs = [4000];
[t,x] = generateChirp(f,t,fs);
```

## (b) Plot the Chirp

_Generate the chirp signal in MATLAB and make a spectrogram with a short section length, LSECT, to verify that you have the correct starting and ending frequencies. For your chosen LSECT, determine the section duration TSECT in secs._

The following code is used to plot the chirp in both the time & frequency domain:

```matlab
%% Plot the Chirp
plotspec( x, 1/fs), colorbar, grid on %-- with negative frequencies
```

## (c) Explain the Chirp Plot

_Explain why the instantaneous frequency seen in the spectrogram goes up and down between zero and $\pm\frac{f_s}{2}$, i.e., it does not chirp up to 11,000 Hz. There are two effects that should be accounted for in your explanation._

1. **Folding Effect:** frequencies where $0 Hz  \le f_{signal} Hz \le \frac{f_{sampling}}{2} Hz$ can be recorded with no loss of information. However, when $\frac{f_{sampling}}{2} Hz  \le f_{signal} Hz \le f_{sampling} Hz$, the associated frequencies can be interpreted either as positive frequencies within the range $\frac{f_{sampling}}{2} Hz  \le f_{signal} Hz \le f_{sampling} Hz$, or as negative frequencies within the range $0 Hz  \le -f_{signal} Hz \le \frac{f_{sampling}}{2} Hz$, or a reflection across the y-axis. However, because the signals are real, they already reflect and duplicate themselves over the y-axis ($\cos t = \frac{e^{j\omega t} + e^{-j\omega t}}2$). As a result, we can only get any useful information on frequencies between $0 Hz  \le f_{signal} Hz \le \frac{f_{sampling}}{2} Hz$.
2. **Aliasing Effect:** Because we have no anti-aliasing filter, the higher-frequency signals present in the signal become noise that confounds the frequency information gathered from the `plotspec(...)` function.
