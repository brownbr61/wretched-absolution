## Pre-Lab

### Objective

Further study the spectral content of the signals analyzed via the _spectrogram_; this will involve the following steps:

1. Synthesize a linear-FM chirp and display its spectrogram with chirp parameters that will deomonstrate aliasing.
2. Synthesize a periodic triangle wave and relate the harmonic line spectrum to the wave's fundamental period using the spectrogram.
3. Compare spectrograms using both logarithmic and linear amplitude.
4. Examine details of the harmonic lines in the logarithmic spectrogram of the triangle wave.
5. _Spectrogram:_ make a spectrogram of voice signal and relate the harmonic line spectrum to previous measurement of pitch period.

### Chirp, or Linearly-Swept Frequency

A linear-FM _chirp_ is a sinusoid whose instantaneous frequency changes linearly from a starting value to an ending one. Instantaneous frequency can be determined by the derivative of the input to its sinusoidal function, for example, the instantaneous frequency of the sinusoidal function $\sin(2\pi f_0t + \varphi)$ is $\frac d{1\pi dt}(2\pi f_0t + \varphi) = f_0$, which is constant. However, if we want the following linearly-increasing instantaneous frequency:
$$f_{instantaneous} = \mu t + f_0$$
then we need to integrate, multiply by $2\pi$, and use it as an argument to our sinusoidal function:
$$2\pi\int f_{instantaneous} = 2\pi\int \mu t + f_0 = 2\pi(\frac12\mu t^t + f_0t) + \varphi = \pi\mu t^2 + 2\pi f_0t + \varphi$$
$\therefore$ the sinusoidal function for a linear-FM chirp signal is:
$$\sin(\pi\mu t^2 + 2\pi f_0t + \varphi)$$
where $\mu = \frac{f_{final} - f_0}{t_{final} - t_0}$.
