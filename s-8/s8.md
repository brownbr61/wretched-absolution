## Pre-Lab

### Objective

Further study the spectral content of the signals analyzed via the _spectrogram_; this will involve the following steps:

1. Synthesize a linear-FM chirp and display its spectrogram with chirp parameters that will deomonstrate aliasing.
2. Synthesize a periodic triangle wave and relate the harmonic line spectrum to the wave's fundamental period using the spectrogram.
3. Compare spectrograms using both logarithmic and linear amplitude.
4. Examine details of the harmonic lines in the logarithmic spectrogram of the triangle wave.
5. _Spectrogram:_ make a spectrogram of voice signal and relate the harmonic line spectrum to previous measurement of pitch period.

### Chirp, or Linearly-Swept Frequency

A linear-FM _chirp_ is a sinusoid whose instantaneous frequency changes linearly from a starting value to an ending one. Instantaneous frequency can be determined by the derivative of the input to its sinusoidal function, for example, the instantaneous frequency of the sinusoidal function $\sin(2\pi f_0t + \varphi)$ is $\frac d{1\pi dt}(2\pi f_0t + \varphi) = f_0$, which is constant. However, if we want the following linearly-increasing instantaneous frequency:
$$f_{instantaneous} = \mu t + f_0$$
then we need to integrate, multiply by $2\pi$, and use it as an argument to our sinusoidal function:
$$2\pi\int f_{instantaneous} = 2\pi\int \mu t + f_0 = 2\pi(\frac12\mu t^t + f_0t) + \varphi = \pi\mu t^2 + 2\pi f_0t + \varphi$$
$\therefore$ the sinusoidal function for a linear-FM chirp signal is:
$$\sin(\pi\mu t^2 + 2\pi f_0t + \varphi)$$
where $\mu = \frac{f_{final} - f_0}{t_{final} - t_0}$.

### Matlab Synthesis of Chirp Signals

We used the following variables to call the [hyperlinked Matlab function `[t,x] = generateChirp(f,t,fs)`](https://github.com/brownbr61/wretched-absolution/blob/master/s-8/generateChirp.m) to generate and plot the following linear-FM chirp:

``` m
f = [0 5];
t = [0 5];
fs = 150;
[t,x] = generateChirp(f,t,fs);
plotspec( x, 1/fs), colorbar, grid on %-- with negative frequencie
```

## Matlab Synthesis of Triangle Wave

We used the following variables to call the [hyperlinked Matlab function `[t,x] = generateTriangle(f,t,fs)`](https://github.com/brownbr61/wretched-absolution/blob/master/s-8/generateTriangle.m) to generate and plot the following triangle wave:

``` m
f = 5;
t = [0 1];
fs = 1000;
[t,x] = generateTriangle(f,t,fs);
plotspec( x, 1/fs), colorbar, grid on %-- with negative frequencie
```

### Decibels

Decibels (dB) is the engineering standard for logarithmic scales, which is defined as $20\log_{10}(A)$ where $A = amplitude$. This can be graphed using the built-in Matlab `spectrogram`; this viewing scale makes two notable changes in interpretation:

1. _Ratios Become Differences:_ An input ratio of $\frac PQ$ will become:
$$ 20\log_{10}\frac PQ = 20\log_{10}P - 20\log_{10} Q $$
2. _Viewable Range must be limited:_ Because $\log0 = -\infty$, minimum dB level must be defined. For example, if a linear amplitude range were $range = [0,1]$, a dB range of 100 would set the viewable dB range to $[-100, 0]$, which viewed linearly would be: $[10^{-100/20},10^{0/20}] = [10^{-5},10^{0}] = [0.00001,1]$.

To get a feel for the $linear:logarithmic$ relationship, the following values will be expressed linearly, then in dB, respectively:

- $0.1 = 20\log_{10} 0.1 = -20 dB$
- $1 = 20\log_{10} = 0 dB$
- $2 = 20\log_{10} 2 = 6.02 dB$
- $5 = 20\log_{10} 0.1 = 13.9 dB$
- $10 = 20\log_{10} 10 = 20 dB$
- $100 = 20\log_{10} 100 = 40 dB$

In addition, the following values will be translated from dB to linear values:

- $-6 dB = \frac12$
- $-60dB = 0.001$
- $-80dB = 0.0001$

### Fourier Series of a Triangle Wave

The zero-mean triangle wave with amplitude $Amp = 0.5$ has the following known Fourier Series:
$$ a_k = \{^{\frac{-2}{\pi^2k^2},k = odd}_{0, k=even} $$
The coefficients for $k = [1,3,5\dotsm,13,15]$ are as follows (as output by matlab):

```sh
index: 1.0000    2.0000    3.0000    4.0000    5.0000    6.0000    7.0000    8.0000
coeff: -0.2026   -0.0225   -0.0081   -0.0041   -0.0025   -0.0017   -0.0012   -0.0009
```

The ratios $k_n:k_1$ are as follows:

```sh
index: 1.0000    2.0000    3.0000    4.0000    5.0000    6.0000    7.0000    8.0000
ratio: 1.0000    0.1111    0.0400    0.0204    0.0123    0.0083    0.0059    0.0044
```
